7. <span class="header_2" id="7">General Terms</span>
    1. <span class="header_3" id="7.1">Entire Agreement.</span>  This Agreement is the only agreement between the parties about its subject and this Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous statements (whether in writing or not) about its subject. <span class="orderform_link">Provider</span> expressly rejects any terms included in <span class="orderform_link">Customer's</span> purchase order or similar document, which may only be used for accounting or administrative purposes. No terms or conditions in any <span class="orderform_link">Customer</span> documentation or online vendor portal will apply to <span class="orderform_link">Customer's</span> use of the Product unless expressly agreed to in a legally binding written agreement signed by an authorized <span class="orderform_link">Provider</span> representative, regardless of what such terms may say.
    2. <span class="header_3" id="7.2">Modifications, Severability, and Waiver.</span>  Any waiver, modification, or change to the Agreement must be in writing and signed or electronically accepted by each party. If any term of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a relevant court or governing body, the remaining terms of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The failure of a party to enforce a term or to exercise an option or right in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver by that party of the term, option, or right.
    3. <span class="header_3" id="7.3">Governing Law and Chosen Courts.</span>  The Governing Law will govern all interpretations and disputes about this Agreement, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

    4. <span class="header_3" id="7.4">Injunctive Relief.</span>  Despite Section 7.3 (Governing Law and Chosen Courts), a breach of Section 6 (Confidentiality) or the violation of a party’s intellectual property rights may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages cannot adequately compensate. As a result, upon the actual or threatened breach of Section 6 (Confidentiality) or violation of a party’s intellectual property rights, the non-breaching or non-violating party may seek appropriate equitable relief, including an injunction, in any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post a bond and without limiting its other rights or remedies.
    5. <span class="header_3" id="7.5">Non-Exhaustive Remedies.</span>  Except where the Agreement provides for an exclusive remedy, seeking or exercising a remedy does not limit the other rights or remedies available to a party.
    6. <span class="header_3" id="7.6">Assignment.</span>  Neither party may assign any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. However, <span class="orderform_link">Provider</span> may assign this Agreement upon notice if <span class="orderform_link">Provider</span> undergoes a merger, change of control, reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all its equity, business, or assets to which this Agreement relates. Any attempted but non-permitted assignment is void. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.
    7. <span class="header_3" id="7.7">Notices.</span>  Any notice, request, or approval about the Agreement must be in writing and sent to the Notice Address.

    8. <span class="header_3" id="7.8">Taxes.</span>  <span class="orderform_link">Customer</span> is responsible for all duties, taxes, and levies that apply to any Fees paid under this Agreement, including sales, use, VAT, GST, or withholding, that <span class="orderform_link">Provider</span> itemizes and includes in an invoice. However, <span class="orderform_link">Customer</span> is not responsible for <span class="orderform_link">Provider's</span> income taxes.
    9. <span class="header_3" id="7.9">Independent Contractors.</span>  The parties are independent contractors, not agents, partners, or joint venturers. Neither party is authorized to bind the other to any liability or obligation.
    10. <span class="header_3" id="7.10">No Third-Party Beneficiary.</span>  There are no third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.
    11. <span class="header_3" id="7.11">Force Majeure.</span>  Neither party will be liable for a delay or failure to perform its obligations of this Agreement if caused by a Force Majeure Event.
